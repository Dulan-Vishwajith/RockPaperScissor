🚀 Simple Rock–Paper–Scissors Game in Java 🎮

I built a console-based Rock–Paper–Scissors game using Java to strengthen my understanding of conditionals, loops, and random number generation.

🔹 Features:

User vs Computer gameplay

Random computer choice using Random

Input validation

Win / Lose / Tie logic

Play again option

This small project helped me practice:
✅ Java basics
✅ Control structures
✅ User input handling
✅ Clean logic implementation

I’m continuously improving my programming skills by creating small and useful applications like this.
